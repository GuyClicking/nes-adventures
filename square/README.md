# Moving square

This was my first complete program. All it is is a square that you can move around with the controller, with a constant note playing in the background. This program taught me a lot of things, being the basics of audio, graphics and controller input.

I didn't write this in an assembler because I started by using nasm, and couldn't be bothered to switch after realising it didn't have any 6502 support (It doesn't have any support right).
